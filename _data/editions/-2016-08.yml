      <p> Here in the Secret Escapes office we had the opportunity to try out the recipe boxes for ourselves. From Mushroom Penne to Balinese Chicken, we turned our ordinary week night dinners in to culinary delights that could have come from a top Michelin star restaurant (even if we do say so ourselves).

But the recipe cards make it easy and quick to make gorgeous, foolproof meals.</p>

        <li> All the money you pay us is fully protected unlike if you book accommodation directly. We are members of ABTA which means should anything happen to us you will still be able to take your holiday or get your money back. Most travel companies offer this protection for flight-inclusive packages but with ABTA we go further and even if you just book accommodation or car hire with us, you are still protected.</li>
        <li> The second point is we have a strict cancellation policy and it is not guaranteed that we’ll be able to refund deposits if a holiday is cancelled. The reason for this is that we work with small hotels and single villas and, unlike a room in a large hotel, it is very difficult to re-allocate the booking if it is cancelled. It is therefore very important that you take out holiday insurance that covers cancellation as soon as you have booked. </li>
        <li> Finally, most of our accommodation providers are small privately owned properties and specifications vary property to property and over time. In fact standards and attention to detail are very high but it is important that you ask us to confirm a feature that is important to you. This may be a simple question as to whether hair-dryers are available (they usually are) or an important point like the protection around a swimming pool for children. We have hundreds of properties on our database and whilst we know most of them personally it is impossible to keep completely abreast at a given point in time. We will however also be happy to check a particular point and on occasion will even get one of our ground team to make a special visit to confirm.</li>
