      <p>If you have longed to bring the tastes and flavours of your holidays home to your kitchen, let us introduce you to our friends at SimplyCook. Their chef­ designed recipe kits are your passport to recreate 50 of the most delicious dishes from around the world. Let’s travel round the continents to find culinary inspiration:</p>
      <p>Asia ­ will you cook the fragrant chicken and noodles of a Malaysian Laksa or serve up the richness of a Chinese Spiced Duck Salad with unique five spice blend</p>
      <p>Africa ­ travel to Morocco and enjoy Chicken Tagine in spicy tomato and chickpea sauce with apricots or dive into a West African Peanut Stew with deep flavours of cocoa, smoky chilli, cinnamon, cloves and oregano</p>
      <p>Middle East ­ create an Iranian Vegetable Stew packed with potatoes, butternut squash, tomatoes and spinach or warm and aromatic Lebanese Lamb with pilaf rice and fresh mint. Europe ­ closer to home, make a beautiful Spanish Paella with saffron, paprika, turmeric and parsley or a deep and creamy Wild Mushroom Penne</p>

      <h4>Tried, tested and recommended by Secret Escapes</h4>
      <p>here in the Secret Escapes office we had the opportunity to tryout the recipe boxes for ourselves.  From Mushroom Penne to Balinese Chicken we turned our ordinary week night dinners in to culinary delights that could have come from a top michelin star restaurant (even if we do say so ourselves). Like many of us after a long day at work the last thing on our minds is to spend hours in the kitchen whipping up a masterpiece. But the recipe card make it easy and quick to make gorgeous foolproof meals.</p>

      <h4>Finca Manzanos Seleccion de la Familia Rioja Blanco</h4>
      <p>For those who have not tried white Rioja - you are in for a treat! Hand-crafted and with a combination of flavour profiles that are simply genius, this wine shines a bright yellow, with hints of gold and an explosive apricot nose! Its character is rounded, at once fresh. You'll find grapefruit, soft pear, honeysuckle and almond notes in this beauty, with a lingering finish of stone fruit... heavenly!</p>
      <h4>The Black Pig Single Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc</h4>
      <p>An extravagant Aussie Sauvignon which delivers all the racy, summer-fresh intensity you could wish for. There's a ripe, mouth-coating structure alongside crisp, gooseberry fruit to boot. Originating from a cool, cool region in Australia (Adelaide Hills) with cool, cool fruit to match, this delightfully clean Sauv Blanc gives the Kiwis a good run for their money!</p>
      <h4>Gran Villa Gran Reserva</h4>
      <p>Gran Villa offers everything and more that you could possibly want out of a Spanish Gran Reserva. Vibrant, cherry red in the glass and an elegant finish that is simply irresistible, this stunning decade-aged red is simply bursting with black-fruit on the nose and palate. Delicious on its own or served alongside a slow cooked roast, lovers of silky, fully mature European classics take note!</p>
      <h4>Seppelt The Victorians Shiraz Cabernet Sauvignon</h4>
      <p>This velvety smooth red is a classic example of what you can expect from an Australian Shiraz Cabernet, and is ideal as a match for rich, flavour packed dishes. This special wine has been sourced from carefully selected vineyards for a perfect balance between power and elegance and is jam-packed with loads of varietal character. Strong, juicy plum flavours abound with plenty of structure and length in this fantastic fruit filled wine.</p>

      <p>Do you know someone who's glued to their iPad? Does all sensible conversation stop as soon as the telly goes on at your house? We know how you feel and that's why IntotheBlue’s experienced team of researchers scoured the length and breadth of the UK to collect the very best days out you could wish for. The range is most definitely eclectic, but does mean there will be something to suit all tastes, budgets and desires.</p>
      <p>Active types are spoilt for choice in this section with plenty of high-altitude thrills on offer, including tackling obstacle courses high up in the trees, throwing yourself off a platform 160ft above the ground with nothing but a length of (admittedly very strong) elastic cable attached to your ankles. If all that sounds too much, but you still want to be outside, how about touring the very lovely Oxford on a bike? It's a great way to combine sightseeing with gentle exercise as you burn off a few calories pedalling. </p>
      <p>When you think of flying, you immediately think of an aeroplane. And whilst IntotheBlue have lessons in light aircraft at aerodromes and airports in every corner of the UK, aerial experiences don't necessarily mean sitting in a plane.
