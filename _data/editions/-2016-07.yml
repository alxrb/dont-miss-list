        <p>If you have longed to bring the tastes and flavours of your holidays home to your kitchen, let us introduce you to our friends at SimplyCook. Their chef designed recipe kits are your passport to recreate 50 of the most delicious dishes from around the world. Let’s travel round the continents to find culinary inspiration:</p>
        <h4>Asia</h4>
        <p>Will you cook the fragrant chicken and noodles of a Malaysian Laksa or serve up the richness of a Chinese Spiced Duck Salad with unique five spice blend</p>
        <h4>Africa</h4>
        <p>travel to Morocco and enjoy Chicken Tagine in spicy tomato and chickpea sauce with apricots or dive into a West African Peanut Stew with deep flavours of cocoa, smoky chilli, cinnamon, cloves and oregano</p>
        <h4>Middle East</h4>
        <p>Create an Iranian Vegetable Stew packed with potatoes, butternut squash, tomatoes and spinach or warm and aromatic Lebanese Lamb with pilaf rice and fresh mint. </p>
        <h4>Europe</h4>
        <p>Closer to home, make a beautiful Spanish Paella with saffron, paprika, turmeric and parsley or a deep and creamy Wild Mushroom Penne</p>
        <p>Using a SimplyCook recipe kit and the step by step instruction card, chefs of all abilities can cook now cook these dishes and many more in just 20 minutes. And you can choose from the whole range which includes vegetarian, gluten free and low calorie options</p>
        <p>Just add a few fresh ingredients from your fridge to the unique spice and flavour pots contained in each recipe kit and get ready for the tastiest journey you have ever been on!</p>

        <h4>Tried, tested and recommended by Secret Escapes</h4>
        <p>Here in the Secret Escapes office we had the opportunity to try out the recipe boxes for ourselves. From Mushroom Penne to Balinese Chicken, we turned our ordinary week night dinners in to culinary delights that could have come from a top Michelin star restaurant (even if we do say so ourselves). Like many of us after a long day at work, the last thing on our minds is to spend hours in the kitchen whipping up a masterpiece. But the recipe cards make it easy and quick to make gorgeous, foolproof meals.</p>

        <h4>Finca Manzanos Seleccion de la Familia Rioja Blanco</h4>
        <p>For those who have not tried white Rioja - you are in for a treat! Hand-crafted and with a combination of flavour profiles that are simply genius, this wine shines a bright yellow, with hints of gold and an explosive apricot nose! Its character is rounded, at once fresh. You'll find grapefruit, soft pear, honeysuckle and almond notes in this beauty, with a lingering finish of stone fruit... heavenly!</p>
        <h4>The Black Pig Single Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc</h4>
        <p>An extravagant Aussie Sauvignon which delivers all the racy, summer-fresh intensity you could wish for. There's a ripe, mouth-coating structure alongside crisp, gooseberry fruit to boot. Originating from a cool, cool region in Australia (Adelaide Hills) with cool, cool fruit to match, this delightfully clean Sauv Blanc gives the Kiwis a good run for their money!</p>
        <h4>Gran Villa Gran Reserva</h4>
        <p>Gran Villa offers everything and more that you could possibly want out of a Spanish Gran Reserva. Vibrant, cherry red in the glass and an elegant finish that is simply irresistible, this stunning decade-aged red is simply bursting with black-fruit on the nose and palate. Delicious on its own or served alongside a slow cooked roast, lovers of silky, fully mature European classics take note!</p>
        <h4>Seppelt The Victorians Shiraz Cabernet Sauvignon</h4>
        <p>This velvety smooth red is a classic example of what you can expect from an Australian Shiraz Cabernet, and is ideal as a match for rich, flavour packed dishes. This special wine has been sourced from carefully selected vineyards for a perfect balance between power and elegance and is jam-packed with loads of varietal character. Strong, juicy plum flavours abound with plenty of structure and length in this fantastic fruit filled wine.</p>
